Developed a user-friendly project database for Liberia's Ministry of Finance and Development Planning. The Dasboard is used by AMCU and the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) for managing external and domestic projects. Including geo-coding functionality, project development indicators and output/outcome indicators to support management, monitoring and evaluation of projects.

The site includes features to export data into Excel format according to Excel templates with validation. Data can be exported in the currency of the relevant donor. It can then be imported back into the system.

Currently, I am working on adding IATI import functionality into the system.
