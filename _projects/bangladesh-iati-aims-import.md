excerpt: Using IATI data to improve the quality of data captured in Bangladesh’s Aid Information Management System.
---
Working with another consultant, I successfully piloted using IATI data in Bangladesh’s Aid Information Management System (AIMS). The goals were to improve the quality of data and reduce the burden on government and donors from data collection. I conducted interviews with government officials and donors in Dhaka to understand the context in depth, and then developed methodologies and technical approaches for data exchange.

I wrote the tender and managed a software supplier to implement technical recommendations and build software providing a sustainable process for using IATI data to supplement locally-collected data. I worked with government officials to design a context-sensitive approach, and delivered presentations on the work in international fora. The approach led to a significant reduction in burden from data collection and a significant increase in data quality for participating donors.
