In this small project, collaborating with [another person](https://twitter.com/andylolz) in our free time, I upgraded the software from Python2 to Python3 as well as upgrading all dependencies. I also added a simple front-end to make it easier to access the data from the underlying API.

The software was originally developed by the Open Knowledge Foundation in 2013. My initial interest was in seeing whether this software could easily be brought back into working order. I am now investigating using this as part of other projects.
