Development of a prototype visualisation of funding to the COVID-19 development response. Data is automatically generated nightly in [a separate repository](https://github.com/OCHA-DAP/covid19-data) using Github Actions. The data is saved to flat files which are then visualised in a front end visualisation, which is built on VueJS (using the [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/) framework).

I supported publishers to improve the quality of their data where necessary. The visualisation was recently handed over to OCHA's Centre for Humanitarian Data for further development.
