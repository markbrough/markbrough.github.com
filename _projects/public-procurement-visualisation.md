Development of a public procurement visualisation for use by the State Procurement Agency, other procuring entities, civil society and private sector. It uses data published by SPA under the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS).

The site was delivered extremely quickly, and includes functionality to generate very large extracts of data in Excel files. These files are generated in the background. The user can continue browsing the site and is informed by an on-screen notification when the file is ready for download.

NB: there currently appears to be an SSL certificates issue on the SPA server hosting this software.
