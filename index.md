## Economist and software developer working on digital transformation

I'm a political economist with over ten years of experience advising on, managing and implementing digital transformation projects in the public and third sectors. I have worked on a diverse range of issues around aid management, PFM and governance, with a particular focus on the links between technical systems and policy processes. I have worked in Bangladesh, France, Georgia, Germany, Liberia, Myanmar, the US, the UK.

My work experience includes advocacy / policy development and technical advice in the government and non-profit sectors, as well as software development (mostly in Python and Nuxt/VueJS). My educational background focused on economics and politics. I have experience in the following areas: aid / IATI data; climate finance; extractive industries / EITI data; IFMIS; integration of aid and IFMIS systems; public procurement and Open Contracting. I speak English and German, with some French and Spanish.
