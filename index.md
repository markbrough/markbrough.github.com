I'm a consultant in open data and development. My work involves <b>applying data and technology to address pressing policy questions</b>. I'm interested in how information can help make broken systems work better.

My past approaches have included advocacy, policy development, data wrangling and programming. My professional experience has focussed on aid, budgets, and the links between the two. I'm an economist by training and based in Berlin.
