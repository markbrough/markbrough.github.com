Led technical, policy and advocacy work on the IATI budget identifier as a mechanism for enabling the integration of aid with partner country budgets, including development of visualisations, coordinating and building consensus among a large group of donors, technical experts and partner countries and coordinating country pilots. Led a methodological review of the Aid Transparency Index to more accurately measure aid transparency and ensure incentives in the Index were well aligned with our broader advocacy goals (this change had a big impact, with 10 new publishers and 10 big improvers). Developed open-source software to automatically assess quality of data published to IATI and to provide a user-friendly survey tool for the Index process, working with/managing consultants. Visualised aid to the Philippines in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda. Conducted advocacy with donors, particularly in the US and France and at IATI Steering Committee, and held meetings in French and German. Engaged with open data community. Led technical work on IATI Standard, including upgrades, organisation identifiers.
