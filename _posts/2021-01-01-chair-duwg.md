The IATI Data Use Working Group (DUWG) is a multi-stakeholder group of volunteers from across the IATI community who work on increasing the use of IATI data.

As Chair, I oversee the management of a substantial member-approved Data Use Fund, including procurement of research, technical tools, and communications activities. I work with a wide range of stakeholders to build consensus around a shared agenda, and spearheaded the development of a new strategic direction through the Data Use Action Plan.
