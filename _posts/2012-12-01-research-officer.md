Campaign focusing on aid transparency, based in London but with a global target audience.

Developed the first visualisation of aid mapped onto a partner country's budget, using data from a 2007 Overseas Development Institute (ODI) report, and got coverage for the visualisation in the Guardian.  Created an "[Aid Transparency Tracker](http://tracker.publishwhatyoufund.org)" as a way to monitor the aid transparency of 58 donors. Designed the original methodology and survey instrument, obtained buy-in from 48 partner NGOs, and provided analysis and text for the 2011 Pilot Aid Transparency Index and subsequent iterations of the Index.

Presented Publish What You Fund's work at conferences around Europe.

Led on our technical engagement with the IATI Standard, incorporating our advocacy asks into this process.
