Led technical, policy and advocacy work on the [IATI budget identifier](http://aidonbudget.org/) as a mechanism for enabling the integration of aid with partner country budgets, including the development of visualisations, and coordinating and building consensus among a large group of donors, technical experts and partner countries.

Led a methodological review of the Aid Transparency Index to more accurately measure aid transparency and ensure the incentives in the Index were well aligned with our broader advocacy goals.

Developed open-source software to automatically assess the quality of data published to IATI and to provide a user-friendly survey tool for managing the Index process, working with consultants. Visualised [aid to the Philippines](https://pwyf.github.io/philippines/) in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda.

Conducted technical advocacy with donors, particularly in the US and France, including holding meetings in French and German.

Engaged extensively with the open data community. Led our technical work on the IATI Standard, including on upgrades and organisation identifiers.
